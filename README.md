# Task-list-with-subtasks
A handy excel used to break down and prioritize your tasks
To fill in your tasks and subtasks expand colomns i for tasks and j for subtasks. After filling in these you can hide them back and correct numeration with your information will appear in colomn H. 
Also the task list has check boxes that will cross out your completed steps. There is a makros for playing victory music of you choise. 
John Perry in his book "The art of procrastination" said that he cant find a task list with music apon completing your task. So I made one and enjoy it very much.
